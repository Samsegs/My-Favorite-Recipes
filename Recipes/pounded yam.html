    <h2>Steps on making Pounded Yam (Using Mortar and Pestle)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a sharp Knife to peel the Yam. Get rid of any discolorations or spots.</li>
        <li>Pour into the water and wash off all dirt immediately after cutting into small, medium or large chunks.</li>
        <li>Using a medium pot, cook the pieces of Yam under high heat with enough water to cover it.</li>
        <li>Boil for approximately 20 minutes until tender. Drain the pieces of Yam thoroughly in a colander immediately after removing them from the heat.</li>
        <li>Keep your mortar and pestle clean by washing them. Start pounding the pieces of yam in parts, not all at once, until smooth and stretchy inside the mortar.</li>
        <li>When necessary, sprinkle water while pounding.</li>
        <li>After pounding all the yams, you can either add a little hot or cold water to  soften it depending on your choice</li>
        <li>Cut out into rolled balls and serve. You can decide to serve in aa covered bowl until the soup is done and you are ready to eat.</li>
    </ol>
