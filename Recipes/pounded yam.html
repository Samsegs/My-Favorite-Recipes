                        <li>Use a sharp Knife to peel the Yam. Get rid of any discolorations or spots.</li>
                        <li>Pour into the water and wash off all dirt immediately after cutting into small, medium or large chunks.</li>
                        <li>Using a medium pot, cook the pieces of Yam under high heat with enough water to cover it. Boil for approximately 20 minutes until tender. Drain the pieces of Yam thoroughly in a colander immediately after removing them from the heat</li>
                        <li>Keep your mortar and pestle clean by washing them. Start pounding the pieces of yam in parts, not all at once, until smooth and stretchy inside the mortar. Sprinkle water when necessary.</li>
                        <li>After pounding all the yams, you can either add a little hot or cold water to  soften it depending on your choice</li>
                        <li>Cut out into rolled balls and serve. You can decide to serve in aa covered bowl until the soup is done and you are ready to eat.</li>
                        <li>In a medium pot, place chicken pieces. Place the dried fish in the pot after it has been rinsed. Add 1 sliced onion, 2 Maggi cubes, and salt to taste.</li>
                        <li>Bring one and a half cups of water to a boil on high heat for 25 minutes. Turn the heat down and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Using a blender, puree the chile peppers and remaining onion. Place onion pepper mixture in a bowl and set aside.</li>
                        <li>To make melon seed powder, place shrimp, crayfish, and melon seeds in a blender. Pulse until powder forms. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Set the spinach aside after squeezing out the excess liquid.</li>
                        <li>The chicken should be tender when finished cooking. Cook for 10 minutes with the blended onion pepper mixture. Remove from heat and stir in sesame seeds.</li>
                        <li>Continue cooking for 20 more minutes and stir in the spinach, oils, add one more Maggi cube.</li>
