                        <li>Blend onion and scotch bonnet pepper together and set aside.</li>
                        <li>In a cooking pot, add your washed chicken wings, half of your blended pepper and onion mixture, 2 seasoning cubes and salt. Add salt according to preference and if you do not like really spicy food, reduce the amount of scotch bonnet used or remove the seeds. Boil until meat is tender, it should take about 15- 20 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Place your chicken wings in the oven and grill on 350 F until wings are golden brown and a little crispy.</li>
                        <li>In the same cooking pot with chicken stock, add remainder of the pepper mixture, ground crayfish, seasoning cube, and water. Cook for 5-7 minutes. If you want your soup thick, add only 3 cups of water but if you want it a little loose add 4 cups.</li>
                        <li>Add your chopped okro, palm oil and cook for 4-5 minutes. Taste for salt and add more if needed.</li>
                        <li>Add your chicken wings and cook soup until okro is completely cooked. It will take about 4-5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add fresh shrimp and spinach and simmer for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Voila! Your soup is ready!</li>
