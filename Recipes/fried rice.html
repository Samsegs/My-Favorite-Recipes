    <p>Fried Rice with Baked Chicken</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of Rice</li>
        <li>4 cups of Chicken broth (I used homemade but you use store-bought chicken broth)</li>
        <li>1 cup of (fresh) mixed bell peppers</li>
        <li>1 cup of chopped onions and garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons of seasoning powder or 2 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt (if needed)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of ground curry (for color and flavor): add one in the broth just before adding rice & use the rest during the “frying.”</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of Olive oil</li>
        <li>2 bare leaves (for boiling the rice)</li>
        <li>Fresh Mint Leaves (optional; for garnishing)</li>
        <li>Parsley (sliced; for garnishing)</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste (as desired)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and cut all the vegetables. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a clean pot, add the broth or stock, usually at a ratio of 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of broth. Also, add bare leaves and 1-2 teaspoons of curry.</li>
        <li>Add washed rice when the broth starts boiling. Usually, the broth is salted, so I do not add additional salt.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 20-25 minutes or until rice is more than halfway cooked (about 75% cooked) and all liquid absorbed. Turn off and set the rice aside. I would normally cook the rice for about 25 minutes or so, depending on the quantity.</li>
        <li>Then in a clean pan, start by frying the vegetables and slowly adding rice to about one cup at a time. Do not overcrowd the pan—just bit by bit. To explain this: set a clean pan on the stove, add oil, then add onion/garlic as it heats up. Cook for 1-2 minutes, add bell peppers, cook another 2 minutes, and add mixed vegetables. Season with a little salt, curry, seasoning cube, or powder, and then add the already cooked rice—Fry to your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust, repeat to fry all the rice. Garnish with parsley and mint leaves. Serve warm with baked chicken thighs.</li>

        <b>Note:
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid overcooking the rice. I always do 1-part rice to 2 parts broth. For instance, to cook one cup of rice, you will need two cups of broth. Sometimes, this may differ depending on the type of rice.</li>
                <li>There is no need to add food coloring to this fried rice recipe; the curry, turmeric, and the vegetables make a great color combination.</li>
                <li>Keep your eyes on the rice while it's cooking.</li>
                <li>There is no need to add salt if you used salted broth; you may need to just add a little salt while frying the rice if need be.</li>
            </ul>
